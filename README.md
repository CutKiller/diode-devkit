# DIODE: A Dense Indoor and Outdoor DEpth Dataset


DIODE (Dense Indoor/Outdoor DEpth) is a dataset that contains diverse high-resolution color images with accurate, dense, and far-range depth measurements. DIODE is the first public dataset to include **RGBD images of indoor and outdoor scenes obtained with one sensor suite**.

Refer to our [homepage](https://diode-dataset.org) and [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00463) for more details.

### Dataset Download
- [Training set](http://diode-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/train.tar.gz), 81GB
- [Validation set](http://diode-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/val.tar.gz), 2.6 GB

### Dataset Layout
DIODE data is organized hierarchically.

### File Naming Conventions
We have released RGB images, depth maps and depth validity masks:

  RGB images (`*.png`): RGB images with a resolution of 1024 Ã— 768.

  Depth maps (`*_depth.npy`): depth ground truth with the same resolution as the images.

  Depth validity masks (`*_depth_mask.npy`): validity masks where 1 denotes valid sensor return and 0 otherwise.

### Devkit
This development toolkit contains
1. A json file that enumerates the data in DIODE. The layout of this file is explained in diode.py. It serves as the single point of reference during dataloading.
2. A sample pytorch data loading module.
3. A jupyter-notebook demo showcasing data loading, metadata querying and depth visualization.
